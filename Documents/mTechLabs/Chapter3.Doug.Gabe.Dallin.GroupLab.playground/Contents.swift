let `guard` = "3.3 Guard"

print("\(`guard`) statement is simple and powerful. It checks for some condition and if it evaluates to be false, then the else statement executes which normally will exit a method. A guard let statement is another way of writing an if let statement written in a different way. You use a guard statement to require that a condition must be true in order for the code after the guard statement to be executed. Unlike an if statement, a guard statement always has an else clauseâ€”the code inside the else clause is executed if the condition is not true.")

// Example of guard

struct Person {
    let firstName: String
    let lastName: String
    var age: String
    var address: String
    let yearYouWereBorn: String
}

let firstNameTextField = UITextView()
let lastNameTextField = UITextView()
let ageTextField = UITextView()
let addressTextField = UITextView()
let yearYouWereBornTextField = UITextView()

firstNameTextField.text = "Bill"
lastNameTextField.text = "Schue"
ageTextField.text = "39"
addressTextField.text = "1827 Provo Dr. Provo UT 39281"
yearYouWereBornTextField.text = "1923"


func createPerson() -> Person? {
    guard let unwrapFirstName = firstNameTextField.text, let unwrapLastName = lastNameTextField.text, let unwrapAge = ageTextField.text, let unwrapAddress = addressTextField.text, let unwrapYearYouWereBorn = yearYouWereBornTextField.text else {return nil}
    
    return Person(firstName: unwrapFirstName, lastName: unwrapLastName, age: unwrapAge, address: unwrapAddress, yearYouWereBorn: unwrapYearYouWereBorn)
}

createPerson()

// Another Example

func greet(person: [String: String]) {
    guard let name = person["name"] else {
        return
    }
    print("Hello \(name)!")
    guard let location = person["location"] else {
        print("I hope the weather is nice near you.")
        return
    }
    print("I hope the weather is nice in \(location).")
}
greet(person: ["name": "John"])
// Prints "Hello John!"
// Prints "I hope the weather is nice near you."
greet(person: ["name": "Jane", "location": "Cupertino"])
// Prints "Hello Jane!"
// Prints "I hope the weather is nice in Cupertino."
